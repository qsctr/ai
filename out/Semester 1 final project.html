<p>My project is a program which checks JavaScript programs for errors and optimizes them. This is related to this course because I have to traverse the AST (abstract syntax tree) of JavaScript programs. And since it is a tree I can use search methods we learned such as depth-first search.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t have a lot of time to work on this project, because of the VEX robotics competition, so there isn&#39;t that much stuff my program can do, but new stuff can easily be added.</p>

<p>Today I found a library for parsing JavaScript into an abstract syntax tree. I also wrote a very basic function to remove empty statements in the syntax tree. Empty statements are basically extra semicolons in the program that are useless.</p>
<h2 id="11-24-2016">11/24/2016</h2>
<p>Today I added a function to remove useless return statements. For example, if the return statement is at the end of the function, and it is returning <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>Today I added stuff to replace the void operator with undefined and detecting return statements outside of a function.</p>
<h2 id="12-4-2016">12/4/2016</h2>
<p>Today I added functions to remove <code>debugger;</code> statements, and to remove unused functions. I am not removing top-level functions since they are in the global scope and might get called from other files, if the script is run in a browser.</p>

<p>Today I added a function to detect variable shadowing, which is when a variable (or parameter or function) in an inner scope has the same name as a variable declared in some outer scope. This is bad because code inside the inner scope cannot reference the outer variable, and it also makes your code more confusing. I also added a function to remove unused variable declarations. It also does not apply to top-level declarations.</p>
